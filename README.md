This project for a fake social media site, 'AstroSocial' allows a user to create an account or log into a preexisting one.
The 'flash' function was utilized to demonstrate mastery of validation in all input fields.
After creating or logging in, the page redirects the user accordingly using session and allows them to log out and exit session.
